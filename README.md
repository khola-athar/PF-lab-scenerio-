Imagine you are organizing a Qawali night event for the first-semester students in your college. You want 
to gather information about the students who are interested in attending the event. You decide to use a 
simple program to collect the names of the interested students and calculate the ticket price and popcorn 
price. 
Here's how the scenario plays out: 
Program Start: 
Initialize two variables ticketPrice and popcornPrice to represent the cost of a ticket and popcorn, 
respectively 
The program starts by asking, "How many users attend the event ‚Äù? (Maximum 10): " 
You enter the number of students who want to attend the Qawali night. 
User Input For Loop: 
The program then enters a loop where it asks for the name of each student one by one. 
For example, it might display: "Enter name for user 1: " 
You input the name of the first student and continue until all names are entered.

After collecting all the names, the program displays the entered names in the format: 
For Example  
User names for the event: 
User 1: [Name1] 
User 2: [Name2] 
... 
Maximum Users Check: 
If you try to input more users than the maximum allowed (10 in this case), the program displays an error 
message: "Error: Not more users allowed." 
Display User Names and Total Cost: 
Inside the loop, The program then calculates the total cost for each user (ticket price + popcorn price) and 
displays it along with the user's name. Finally, it calculates and displays the total cost for all users. You can 
adjust the ticketPrice and popcornPrice values according to your requirements. 
Display Total Cost:
